Organize your tabs into domain controllers.

How to install
--------------

Installation without the Chrome Web Store is slightly more confusing than usual. Head on over to the downloads page to grab the .CRX extension file. Download it and drag the downloaded file into your Settings -> Extensions. Chrome will ask to install it, so hit yes and the magic should happen.

Where did all my tabs go?!
--------------------------

Your tabs are safely kept in a new window, called the "tab container." The container allows us to keep tab states and not lose our tabs once the extension is disabled. To access the tab container, right-click on your chrome icon. For the time being, the main page is simply a new tab page. Find that window and open it up to gain access to all your tabs.
